🥗 FitPlate – AI-Powered Personal Meal Planner
FitPlate is a personal project built with ❤️ to help people like me eat better, stay healthy, and reach their fitness goals without stress or guesswork. This app utilizes AI to generate personalized meal plans tailored to your goals, dietary preferences, and daily calorie requirements.

This project matters deeply to me — I built FitPlate not just to learn full-stack development, but because I've personally struggled to balance healthy eating with a busy lifestyle. I wanted a tool that helps real people stay on track, without needing to hire a dietitian or spend hours planning meals.
